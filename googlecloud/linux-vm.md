# Running a Linux VM on Google Cloud Compute

It is quite simple.

 - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances
 - Create an instance
 - Choose a name
 - Choose the N1 class (or anything by E)
 - Choose the operating system (Debian)
 - Choose disk size (10G)
 - Start
 
The per-hour cost is quite reasonable ($0.07/hour) for the lowest spec CPU. And you can suspend it if you don't need it and have it resumed ($0.17/month).
